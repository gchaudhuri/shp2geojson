# Convert Shapefile to GeoJson Format

A simple script using geopandas to convert shapefile to geojson.
In my personal experience, direct export to geojson using ArcGIS generates errors when that geojson file is used in opensource libraries. That's why I find using an open source library to perform conversion less error prone, easier and faster. [Here is the code](https://github.com/gchaudhuri/shp2geojson/blob/main/shp2geojson.py).
